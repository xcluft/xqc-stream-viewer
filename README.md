# xQc Stream Viewer

The xQc Stream Viewer is a convenient interface designed to allow fans of the popular streamer xQc to easily switch between his Twitch and Kick streams. This web interface is hosted at https://xcluft.github.io/xqc-stream-viewer/.

## Features:
- Seamless switching between Twitch and Kick streams with a single click.
- Easy swapping of chat positions to be either on the left or right side of the stream.
- A responsive design that adjusts to different window sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience.
- Minimalistic UI with essential controls.

## Usage:
- **Stream:** Switches the streaming platform between Twitch and Kick.
- **Chat:** Toggles the chat's position from left to right, and vice versa.

In compact mode, the stream and chat interface stack vertically for a better viewing experience. The chat is always positioned underneath the stream in this mode.

## Logging In:

### Twitch:
To log in to Twitch, navigate to the Twitch chat and attempt to type a message. You will be presented with a prompt to log in, displaying the message "Login will open in a separate window." Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the login process. Please be aware that this will also log you into the Twitch player. As far as Twitch is concerned, you are directly on their site, which means you will continue to see your progress in vods, receive drops, moments, etc.

### Kick:
To remove the cookie prompt on Kick, please first navigate to [Kick.com](https://www.kick.com/). Once there, consent to their cookie policy and then refresh the xQc Stream Viewer. Unfortunately, due to the way Kick's authentication system is currently set up, you cannot sign into Kick directly from the xQc Stream Viewer.

If you encounter errors while trying to log in, it's possible that your browser settings or extensions are blocking third-party cookies. Make sure to adjust your settings to allow third-party cookies if you want to use this feature.
