**xQc Stream Viewer**

The xQc Stream Viewer is a convenient interface designed to allow fans of the popular streamer xQc to easily switch between his Twitch and Kick streams. This web interface is hosted at https://xcluft.github.io/xqc-stream-viewer/.


Features:

    Seamless switching between Twitch and Kick streams with a single click.
    Easy swapping of chat positions to be either on the left or right side of the stream.
    A responsive design that adjusts to different window sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience.
    Minimalistic UI with essential controls.

Usage:

    Stream: Switches the streaming platform between Twitch and Kick.
    Chat: Toggles the chat's position from left to right, and vice versa.

In compact mode (window width less than 1000px), the stream and chat interface stack vertically for a better viewing experience. The chat is always positioned underneath the stream in this mode.
